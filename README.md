## 🌟 Projects & Highlights

- **Cleo – AI Discord Bot:**  
  My flagship project. Cleo is an all-in-one Discord bot that can moderate communities, entertain users, and act as a virtual assistant. She’s fueled by AI and a bit of sass, making Discord chats more fun and informative.  

- **Cleo Dashboard:**  
  Alongside the bot, I’m building a full **web dashboard** for Cleo (Next.js, Prisma, etc.) to let users manage settings and view analytics.  
  *Coming soon as open-source!* ➡️ [Cleo-Dashboard Repository](https://github.com/jcodog/Cleo-Dashboard)  

- **JCoNet LTD Website & Blog:**  
  I’ve developed the official JCoNet website (Next.js + Tailwind) and a tech blog where I share development updates and insights.  
  ➡️ [JCoNet-LTD Website Repo](https://github.com/jcodog/JCoNet-LTD)  

- **Open Source Contributions:**  
  I enjoy crafting tools for fellow developers – like a simple [Top.GG Webhook listener](https://github.com/JCoNet/node-topgg-webhook) for Discord bot votes, and a fun *TikTok Tutorial Bot*.
